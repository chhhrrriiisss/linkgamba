## About

~description of project goes here~

## Build Notes

- Requires [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/) for compilation to /dist folder and processing while in development. Uses [.less](lesscss.org/) for CSS compilation. Alternatively use your own tool to compile and just work from /src directory. 
- Run cmd from the root folder and use **grunt watch** while you are editing files to auto-compile .js, then use **grunt dist** to build and compile to the /dist folder when you are ready for production.
- .gitignore entry included for /node_modules folders.
- Source files folder contains a handful of photoshop files used for creating the icons and spritesheets.
